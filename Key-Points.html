  <h2>Key Points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Software design and implementation are interleaved activities. The level of detail in the design depends on the type of system being developed and whether you are using a plan-driven or agile approach.
    </li>
    <li>
      The process of object-oriented design includes activities to design the system architecture, identify objects in the system, describe the design using different object models, and document the component interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
      A range of different models may be produced during an object-oriented design process. These include static models (class models, generalization models, association models) and dynamic models (sequence models, state machine models).
    </li>
    <li>
      Component interfaces must be defined precisely so that other objects can use them. A UML interface stereotype may be used to define interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
      When developing software, you should always consider the possibility of reusing existing software, either as components, services, or complete systems.
    </li>
  <li> Configuration management is the process of managing changes to an evolving software system. It is essential when a team of people are cooperating to develop software
</li>
<li> Most software development is host-target development. You use an IDE on a host machine to develop the software, which is transferred to a target machine for execution.

</li>

<li> Open source development involves making the source code of a system publicly available. This means that many people can propose changes and improvements to the software.
</li>
  
</ul>

<ul>
<p>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-oriented Software. This is the original software
 patterns handbook that introduced software patterns to a wide community. (E. Gamma, R. Helm, 
R. Johnson and J. Vlissides, Addison-Wesley, 1995.)</p>

<p> Applying UMLand Patterns: An Introduction to Object-oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative
 Development, 3rd edition. Larman writes clearly on object-oriented design and, as well as
 discussing the use of the UML. This is a good introduction to using patterns in the design process.
 (C. Larman, Prentice Hall, 2004.)</p>

 <p> Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project. His book is a
 comprehensive guide to the background to open source software, licensing issues, and the
 practicalities of running an open source development project. (K. Fogel, Oâ€™Reilly Media Inc., 2008.)</p>

 <p>Further reading on software reuse is suggested in Chapter 16 and on configuration management 
in Chapter 25.</p>
